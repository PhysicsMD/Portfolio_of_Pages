        <h2>LP Bailey – Lead Vocals</h2>
        <div class="description">
        <div class='imgArea'><img src="/images/profile/LP.jpg"></div>
        <div class='textArea'>
        <p>Liatt Paul (LP) Bailey has been singing and fronting bands for over 30 years. LP is also a skilled percussionist playing the
            drums and the Taiko drum. LP draws from a deep well of vocal influences ranging from John Denver to Glen Danzig and anyone in
            between. As LP puts it, “Some days it’s Sinatra, some days it’s Slayer!” Having a collection of over 10,000 CD, cassettes, and
            record albums certainly backs that up. Though his musical tastes and influences are broad, there are still some things LP will
            not listen to – opera and Nirvana!
        </p>
        <p>In his spare time LP loves outdoor activities such as rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, scuba diving, and surfing. In the winter time you might bump into him on the slopes snowboarding. Those kinds of activities certainly contribute to the amount of energy that LP brings to the stage. Crew 101 is fortunate to have such talent with us every time we take the stage.</p>

        <h2>Carol Martin – Lead Vocals</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <div class='imgArea'><img src="/images/profile/Carol.jpg"></div>
            <div class='textArea'>
        <p>Carol started her musical journey like most kids growing up singing into a hairbrush in front of a mirror. She eventually graduated to
            Karaoke and got so good with her abilities that she made the leap to singing in bands some 11 years ago and hasn’t looked back. Carol’s
            first band experience was singing some rock & roll Christmas tunes, but her first real rock song was Bonnie Raitt’s Something to Talk About.
            Carol’s musical influences include classical music, rock, alternative, and country. But her biggest influences come from powerhouse vocalist
            from the 70s, 80s and 90s such as Belinda Carlisle, Taylor Dayne, Linda Ronstadt, Pat Benetar, and Stevie Nicks.</p>
        <p>In her spare time, Carol enjoys photography, painting, and crafting. You might see her at a park working a photography shoot for a client!</p>

        <h2>Kevin Martin – Drums</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <div class='imgArea'><img  src="/images/profile/Kevin.jpeg"></div>
            <div class='textArea'>
        <p>Kevin has been playing drums since the age of 12 when he begged his older brother to teach him how to play. His biggest musical influences include
            drummers such as his older brother, Neal Peart, and Jon Bonham. Through the years he has had a wealth of opportunity playing for people such
            as Glen Campbell, as well as performing for popular Nascar drivers such as Dale Earnhardt Jr.</p>
        <p>Originally from the small town of Wanatah, Indiana where it gets pretty cold in the winter, Kevin has fallen in love with the Carribean and loves to
            travel to the Carribean islands with his wife Carol and his close friends. He is a “Parrot Head” through and through (Jimmy Buffet reference)
            and you just might find him on a beach somewhere in the Carribean if you’re lucky.</p>

        <h2>Carl Harris – Guitar</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <div class='imgArea'><img  src="/images/profile/Carl.jpg"></div>
            <div class='textArea'>
        <p>Carl’s passion for playing music started in high school when he started his first band playing all original music that he wrote
            or co-wrote. Carl has played in numerous bands including an Iron Maiden tribute band. Playing in Crew 101 has allowed him to expand his guitar playing abilities by playing songs from some of his favorite
            artist. As Carl puts it “Music is so much fun, it just helps get you through your day. I always want to put on a good show so the
            audience has a good time.”</p>
        <p>One interesting thing about Carl is he once participated in team cattle roping. The desire to play music outweighed his desire to
            be a rodeo star and we are glad for that!</p>

        <h2>Jon Brumbaugh – Bass Guitar</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <div class='imgArea'><img  src="/images/profile/Jon.jpg"></div>
            <div class='textArea'>
        <p>Jon Brumbaugh has been playing bass guitar in bands for well over 30 years. In addition to playing bass guitar, Jon’s first love was
            playing regular guitar. Jon’s influences range anywhere from country to hard rock. Some of his favorite bass players include
            Ross Valory, Geddy Lee, Pete Way, and John Taylor. Much like LP there some days Jon loves to listen to Waylon Jennings, and
            other days it will be Def Leppard. “I love guitar driven, melodic music. It doesn’t matter if it is country, blues, or rock – it just
            has to have those elements.”</p>
        <p>In his spare time Jon loves fishing, gaming, spending time with family, and good scifi programs and movies. You might bump into him up at Woods Canyon Lake or Willow Springs Lake as those are two of his favorite fishing spots.

            Jon has played hundreds of live gigs over the years and brings a wealth of experience to Crew 101. Jon is really enjoying the time with
            the band and feels blessed and fortunate to be able to play with a fine group of people.</p>
